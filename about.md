title: About Me
---

Hey, I’m Yu Cheng(Victor) Chen.  I'm currently based in Seattle studying ECE MS at UW.
Previously I doubled major in Computer Science and Physics in National Cheng Kung University.

I started this blog to encourage myself to share more of my thoughts and ideas instead of letting them slip away. Sometimes I would only jot down a few bullet points to capture a reflection, but I believe that writing in full paragraphs helps me see things from more angles and reflect more deeply. This blog is also a way for me to improve my writing while documenting the small and big moments in my journey.

I believe feedback is the best gift. I’m always eager to hear your thoughts, suggestions, or recommendations, whether it’s a great article, an inspiring speech, or any idea that sparks your interest.

### Things I'm Involved With

**Software.** I believe software is a superpower. It is scalable, affordable, and capable of creating meaningful impact. I’ve built projects in machine learning and full-stack development, which you can check out [here](/portfolio.html).

**Startup.** I am passionate about innovation and problem-solving. I love the startup spirit, being proactive, adaptable, and growth-oriented. I thrive in environments that value experimentation, following a build, measure, learn cycle to drive progress.

**Soccer.** I have played competitive soccer for most of my life. Over ten years on the varsity team [shaped who I am today](./_posts/2025-6-26-How soccer shaped me.md). I can be extremely competitive sometimes.

**Baking.** I started learning to bake after moving to Seattle. It has been a wonderful way to unwind without screens, and a privilege to share what I make with people around me. I keep notes on every recipe I try and enjoy tweaking them bit by bit. [Here is my recipe collection.](/recipes/)

### Contact

I'm always looking forward to meeting and collaborating with new people.
