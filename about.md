title: About Me
---

Hey, Iâ€™m Yu Cheng(Victor) Chen.  I'm currently based in Seattle studying ECE MS at UW.

Previously I doubled major in Computer Science and Physics in National Cheng Kung University.

### Things I'm Involved With

**Software.** I believe software is a superpower. It is scalable, affordable, and capable of creating meaningful impact. I have built machine learning projects that range from predicting the survivability of cancer patients, to forecasting multi-hazard risks on power grids, to analyzing soccer performance. I also taught myself full-stack development and worked as a software engineer at Gigwok, Inc., where I helped make mental health care more engaging.

**Startup.** I am passionate about innovation and problem-solving. I love the startup spirit, being proactive, adaptable, and growth-oriented. I thrive in environments that value experimentation, following a build, measure, learn cycle to drive progress.

**Soccer.** I have played competitive soccer for most of my life. Over ten years on the varsity team [shaped who I am today](./_posts/2025-6-26-How soccer shaped me.md). I can be extremely competitive sometimes.

**Baking.** I started learning to bake after moving to Seattle. It has been a wonderful way to unwind without screens, and a privilege to share what I make with people around me. I keep notes on every recipe I try and enjoy tweaking them bit by bit. [Here is my recipe collection.](/baking-recipes/)
