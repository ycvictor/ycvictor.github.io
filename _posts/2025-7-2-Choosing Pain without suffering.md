# Choosing Pain without suffering

As a child, when you touched something hot, you felt pain. That pain was information: it taught you it could hurt you.

When I sign up for a marathon, I’m signing up for pain. It’s never easy to push myself again and again, and whether I keep going is up to me.

Over the past year, I’ve realized I actually enjoy most of the pain. I enjoy pushing myself while running and swimming, falling down while skiing, grinding hard while job hunting, and more. There’s a saying: “Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional.” You can choose pain without choosing suffering.

When I went skiing for the first time, I fell every few steps. It hurt, but it taught me how to adjust. I knew I was learning, and I loved seeing myself grow stronger each time.

Self-discipline is the highest form of self-love. Sometimes, discipline brings pain, but you decide whether to suffer or to embrace the process. If you can learn to manage your suffering and see your scars as beautiful, you will become invincible.

When you feel pain, ask yourself what it’s trying to teach you. If it’s useful, seek the next pain.

You’ll be proud of who you become.
