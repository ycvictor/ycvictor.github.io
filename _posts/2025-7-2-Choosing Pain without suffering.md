# Choosing Pain without suffering

As a child, when you touched something hot, you felt pain. That pain served as information: it taught you that it could hurt you.

When I sign up for a marathon, I’m signing up for pain. It’s never easy to push myself again and again, and whether I keep running or not is up to me.

Over the past year, I’ve realized that I actually enjoy most of the pain. I enjoy every moment of pushing myself while running and swimming, falling down while skiing, grinding hard while searching for a job, and more. It’s been said that “pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional.” You can choose pain without choosing suffering.

When I went skiing for the first time, I fell down every few steps. It hurt, but it also taught me how to adjust. I knew I was learning, and I truly enjoyed seeing myself grow stronger.

Self-discipline is the ultimate expression of self-love. Sometimes, self-discipline brings pain, but you are the one who decides whether to suffer or to embrace the process. If you can learn to control your suffering and accept that your scars are beautiful, you will become inevitable.

When you feel pain, ask yourself what information it’s giving you. If it’s useful, seek the next pain. You’ll be proud of yourself.
