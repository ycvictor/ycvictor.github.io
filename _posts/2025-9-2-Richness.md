# Richness

For a long time, when i thought of richness, the first thing came to mind was money. But after a year in Seattle, my perspective has completely changed.

I’ve met so many people who fit the stereotype of being “rich”, working in big tech, able to buy whatever they want, generously tipping without hesitation. And yet, I’ve noticed something important: some of them don’t take care of their health, staying on call late at night or buried in endless workloads. Some are couples who seem disconnected, never wanting to spend time together alone. Others constantly talk about their compensation at social events, indifferent to the people around them—even when it’s clear that others are exhausted by the conversation.

Watching this, I realized that money can give you options, but it cannot replace the fundamental things that make life meaningful. What truly draws me in are the people who are rich in spirit. These are the ones who inspire through curiosity, kindness, creativity, and the courage to live according to their values. Some of them haven’t even begun to earn much money, yet the way they live and the choices they make are already captivating.

I’ve come to understand that the richness I want isn’t about accumulating wealth. It’s about cultivating a life full of meaning, connection, and purpose.

I want to pursue richness in spirit, not just in money.
