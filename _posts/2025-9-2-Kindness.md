# Kindness

Recently, I brought my friend’s friends on a tour of Seattle and took them to a café that is one of my mom’s favorites. I could tell how they felt just from their reaction after a sip of coffee. I don’t mean that anyone should pretend to like something, but if I were in her place, I might notice different aspects—like the smoothness, a unique flavor, or even, if the coffee isn’t perfect, the cozy vibe of the café. A thoughtful comment like that can make the host feel appreciated.

Similarly, if someone cooks for you, even if the flavor isn’t exactly your preference, you can highlight something you enjoy and then offer gentle feedback.

I read a book that mentioned how leaving room for others’ contributions is also a form of kindness. For example, if you host a party and don’t require guests to bring food, you can still allow them to bring a gift or let them know they’re welcome to bring something they enjoy, so they feel included and equal.

Kindness often shows up in the small details of behavior, and responding positively to a gift or effort from someone else is itself a way of showing kindness.
