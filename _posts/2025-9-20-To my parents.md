# To my parents

For the past few years, I often felt more mature than my parents. I can look at problems from different perspectives, face challenges rationally, analyze the pros and cons, and make decisions that are most suitable for us. I have clarity about the path I want to pursue, the life I want to live, and the person I want to become. I have dreams, I take action, and I rarely waste time.

After listening to a podcast, I realized that my parents always tried their best to help me grow in the way they thought was best. Although it might not have been the perfect or ideal way, they ensured that I could stand on their shoulders. This made me feel both guilty and incredibly luckyâ€”to have parents whose efforts and love I can truly feel.

In the future, I would also give everything I have to my children. I might make mistakes, but I can ensure that they will be able to stand on my shoulders and see the world more clearly.
