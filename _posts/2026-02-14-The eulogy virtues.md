# The Eulogy Virtues

Recently, I’ve been thinking a lot about how I should adjust the way I treat people.

I once wrote that life moves quickly, and that I’ve already lived through a third of it. I want to experience as many emotions as I can, both the beautiful ones and the painful ones. Because of that, I try to give my all in everything I do, especially when it comes to the people around me. I like that version of myself.

But in doing so, I sometimes hear things I never expected. Some people think I do too much. Some wonder if my kindness means I like someone. Some tell me that love should be measured and given in proportion. Sometimes it even begins to affect my own life. I always try to find reasons for them. I choose to believe they are kind, because if I were them, I would want someone to treat me that way too.

There are moments when I wonder if I’m trying too hard to be a kind of superhero, believing I can endlessly give love to the people around me, while forgetting that the weight I carry keeps growing heavier.

Over these past few days, I’ve come to realize that this is simply who I am. Maybe the answer is to keep doing what feels true to me. No matter how others interpret it, no matter how they respond to my sincerity, as long as I can say I acted without regret, that is enough. And perhaps someday, if we drift apart, they might still remember how it felt. Maybe a small trace of warmth will remain. Maybe that alone is enough.

In Seattle, I’ve noticed how many people care deeply about their job titles, their status, and how much they earn. Some begin to see themselves as above others, forgetting gratitude and don't care about other people. Every time I see it, it feels strangely hollow. Strip away the labels, and there is nothing left that truly defines who they are.

I want to always remember this: Never sacrifice eulogy virtues in the pursuit of resume virtues. To keep doing what I believe is right. To give what I can give. To remain someone with a soul.
