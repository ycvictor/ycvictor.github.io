# Excuses vs. Barriers

Lately, I’ve spoken with a few people, and reflecting on their experiences—and my own—made one thing clear: if you want the life you truly want, you have to keep asking yourself hard questions.

One person said they were too lazy to apply for a position. But why not start somewhere and improve along the way? Why not treat it as practice? Why not use it to strengthen your other opportunities? Often, the cost of trying is small, while the potential gain is huge. Avoiding it entirely usually reflects fear more than laziness.

Another person said they failed interviews because they need sponsorship. But if a company truly avoids candidates who need sponsorship, they likely wouldn’t even grant a first interview. So is sponsorship really the full reason for rejection? Or is there something you could still improve for next time? Treating every rejection as an external constraint quietly stops growth. Seize every opportunity to learn and improve.

Someone else said they couldn’t find the motivation to apply for an exchange program. If money isn’t the barrier, is spending half a year traveling in Europe really not motivating enough? Or are you afraid of delaying graduation? Afraid you won’t get into a good exchange school? Afraid that, after half a year, you still won’t know what you want to do and will fall behind? Maybe the applications and planning feel exhausting. These fears are understandable, but reflecting on them deeply can help you understand yourself better.

Job hunting is the same. It’s easy to blame a “bad market.” But is that really why you can’t find a job?

Facing social pressure when you feel unprepared isn’t easy. The simplest way to cope is to give yourself an excuse. I’m not against using small excuses to navigate socially, but never let them stop you from uncovering the real barriers holding you back.

The moment you stop asking yourself hard questions is often the moment you stop moving forward.
