# How to Get Work-Life Balance?

Someone once asked my instructor,
“How can I keep gaining knowledge while working?”

He replied,
“Do you read any books that aren’t required for class? If yes, then you’re already gaining knowledge. If not, then maybe you need to think about it.”

I feel it’s totally the same with work-life balance.

Ask yourself: Do you have balance right now? If yes, keep going. If not, it might be worth reflecting on what you’re chasing.

It often starts with a goal: getting into a good school, then landing a stable job, then earning a better salary, buying a house, getting promoted, even comparing your children’s achievements. There’s always a new carrot dangling in front of you, leading to the next thing, and the next, without end.

It’s easy to get caught in this loop, believing you’ll rest after the “next goal.” But life doesn’t always slow down for you to find balance; you have to create it.

Balance isn’t about doing less or giving up your ambitions. It’s about making space for what matters outside of work, such as your health, your hobbies, your family, your quiet time, and letting these become part of your rhythm, not something you squeeze in when you’re too tired.

Just like reading outside of class shows you’re still learning, taking small steps each day to enjoy life outside of work shows you’re living.

If you’re not feeling balanced, maybe it’s time to ask yourself:
“What is the next carrot I’m chasing, and is it worth it right now?”
