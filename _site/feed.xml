But after a year in Seattle, my perspective has completely changed.</p>

<p>I’ve met so many people who fit the stereotype of being “rich”, working in big tech, able to buy whatever they want, generously tipping without hesitation. And yet, I’ve noticed something important: some of them don’t take care of their health, staying on call late at night or buried in endless workloads. Some are couples who seem disconnected, never wanting to spend time together alone. Others constantly talk about their compensation at social events, indifferent to the people around them—even when it’s clear that others are exhausted by the conversation.</p>

<p>Watching this, I realized that money can give you options, but it cannot replace the fundamental things that make life meaningful. What truly draws me in are the people who are rich in spirit. These are the ones who inspire through curiosity, kindness, creativity, and the courage to live according to their values. Some of them haven’t even begun to earn much money, yet the way they live and the choices they make are already captivating.</p>

<p>I’ve come to understand that the richness I want isn’t about accumulating wealth. It’s about cultivating a life full of meaning, connection, and purpose.</p>

<p>I want to pursue richness in spirit, not just in money.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Other" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a long time, when i thought of richness, the first thing came to mind was money.

I could tell how they felt just from their reaction after a sip of coffee. I don’t mean that anyone should pretend to like something, but if I were in her place, I might notice different aspects—like the smoothness, a unique flavor, or even, if the coffee isn’t perfect, the cozy vibe of the café. A thoughtful comment like that can make the host feel appreciated.</p>

<p>Similarly, if someone cooks for you, even if the flavor isn’t exactly your preference, you can highlight something you enjoy and then offer gentle feedback.</p>

<p>I read a book that mentioned how leaving room for others’ contributions is also a form of kindness. For example, if you host a party and don’t require guests to bring food, you can still allow them to bring a gift or let them know they’re welcome to bring something they enjoy, so they feel included and equal.</p>

<p>Kindness often shows up in the small details of behavior, and responding positively to a gift or effort from someone else is itself a way of showing kindness.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Other" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I brought my friend’s friends on a tour of Seattle and took them to a café that is one of my mom’s favorites.

<ol>
  <li>They feel you won’t listen.</li>
  <li>They feel you won’t change.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the first point, some people ask for feedback but when they receive it, they immediately make excuses like, “I did that because…,” or “That was an exception, normally I wouldn’t do that.” Even worse, some get angry when hearing things they don’t want to hear. Whenever you receive feedback, remember: no excuses.</p>

<p>For the second point, if you give feedback to someone but never see them take action, you might feel they don’t want to change. As a result, you might stop giving feedback, even if you think it’s important. At the end of the day, it’s their life, not yours.</p>

<p>Both points remind me to really listen when I get feedback and act on what I want to change. When people see that, they will feel more comfortable giving honest feedback, and that helps me grow.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Other" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[People might not give you feedback for two main reasons:]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Choosing Pain without suffering</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/07/02/Choosing-Pain-without-suffering.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Choosing Pain without suffering" /><published>2025-07-02T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2025-07-02T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/07/02/Choosing%20Pain%20without%20suffering</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/07/02/Choosing-Pain-without-suffering.html"><![CDATA[<p>As a child, when you touched something hot, you felt pain. That pain was information: it taught you it could hurt you.</p>

<p>When I sign up for a marathon, I’m signing up for pain. It’s never easy to push myself again and again, and whether I keep going is up to me.</p>

<p>Over the past year, I’ve realized I actually enjoy most of the pain. I enjoy pushing myself while running and swimming, falling down while skiing, grinding hard while job hunting, and more. There’s a saying: “Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional.” You can choose pain without choosing suffering.</p>

<p>When I went skiing for the first time, I fell every few steps. It hurt, but it taught me how to adjust. I knew I was learning, and I loved seeing myself grow stronger each time.</p>

<p>Self-discipline is the highest form of self-love. Sometimes, discipline brings pain, but you decide whether to suffer or to embrace the process. If you can learn to manage your suffering and see your scars as beautiful, you will become invincible.</p>

<p>When you feel pain, ask yourself what it’s trying to teach you. If it’s useful, seek the next pain.</p>

<p>You’ll be proud of who you become.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Other" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a child, when you touched something hot, you felt pain.

“How can I keep gaining knowledge while working?”</p>

<p>He replied,
“Do you read any books that aren’t required for class? If yes, then you’re already gaining knowledge. If not, then maybe you need to think about it.”</p>

<p>I feel it’s totally the same with work-life balance.</p>

<p>Ask yourself: Do you have balance right now? If yes, keep going. If not, it might be worth reflecting on what you’re chasing.</p>

<p>It often starts with a goal: getting into a good school, then landing a stable job, then earning a better salary, buying a house, getting promoted, even comparing your children’s achievements. There’s always a new carrot dangling in front of you, leading to the next thing, and the next, without end.</p>

<p>It’s easy to get caught in this loop, believing you’ll rest after the “next goal.” But life doesn’t always slow down for you to find balance; you have to create it.</p>

<p>Balance isn’t about doing less or giving up your ambitions. It’s about making space for what matters outside of work, such as your health, your hobbies, your family, your quiet time, and letting these become part of your rhythm, not something you squeeze in when you’re too tired.</p>

<p>Just like reading outside of class shows you’re still learning, taking small steps each day to enjoy life outside of work shows you’re living.</p>

<p>If you’re not feeling balanced, maybe it’s time to ask yourself:
“What is the next carrot I’m chasing, and is it worth it right now?”</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Other" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Someone once asked my instructor, “How can I keep gaining knowledge while working?”]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How soccer shaped me</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/26/How-soccer-shaped-me.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How soccer shaped me" /><published>2025-06-26T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2025-06-26T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/06/26/How%20soccer%20shaped%20me</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/26/How-soccer-shaped-me.html"><![CDATA[<p>Soccer has been a part of my life for more than 15 years, ever since I was nine. At that age, most parents just want their kids to stay active or make new friends, and I’m incredibly grateful that my parents chose soccer for me. Looking back, that simple decision shaped not only my childhood but also the person I’ve become.</p>

<p>From elementary school onward, I joined every varsity soccer team except during middle school. At that time, my parents hoped I could balance academics and athletics, so they enrolled me in a special program that focused on both. Unfortunately, that program didn’t include soccer.</p>

<p>Ironically, I had been swimming even longer than I had been playing soccer. But unlike soccer, I never loved it. Swimming felt exhausting and isolating. The pool was cold, and the environment lacked connection. The people I trained with felt more like competitors than teammates. We rarely exchanged tips or encouragement. During practice, our coach often sat by the pool, scrolling through his phone while we swam lap after lap with little guidance.</p>

<p>I remember once, desperate for a break, I pretended to go to the bathroom just to escape the routine. Another time, I tried hiding underwater near the coach to skip a lap, but obviously, it didn’t work. I came up gasping, with tears mixing into the water inside my goggles, and silently finished the lap.</p>

<p>Soccer, on the other hand, brought much more connection, energy, and joy. I still remember how, in elementary school, we would squeeze in training during the longest class breaks. In university, we called each other to plan solo practices, pushing ourselves together to earn a spot in Division One. That shared commitment created a bond that extended far beyond the field.</p>

<p>But the journey was never easy. There were endless repetitions of fundamental drills and physically demanding workouts that pushed us to our limits just like any other sport. It was during those tough sessions that I realized studying actually felt much easier compared to the grit and effort we poured into soccer. And nothing hurt more than giving our all, only to fall short. One memory that still stays with me is the heartbreak of conceding a last-minute equalizer and losing in extra time during a championship game that could have promoted us to Division One.</p>

<p>I never won any major title. But over time, I came to understand that the journey gave me something far more meaningful. The bonds we built through shared struggle have lasted for years. Many of my closest friends today are still the teammates I met back in elementary school. Though we don’t see each other often, whenever we meet, it feels like nothing has changed. The same jokes, the same stories, and the same laughter always bring us back to those good old days.</p>

<p>Looking back, both soccer and swimming taught me lessons I’ll carry for life. Swimming taught me how to compete with myself and strive to improve over time. Soccer taught me the power of teamwork, discipline, and trust. Together, they taught me resilience, focus, and the importance of trusting the process and staying consistent even when things get tough. And most importantly, they taught me to never stop striving to be better.</p>

<p>I may not have collected trophies, but the life lessons I gained along the way are worth far more.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Other" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soccer has been a part of my life for more than 15 years, ever since I was nine.

<p>身邊陸續的一些事件，不禁讓我反思自己應對的情緒以及方式，藉此更了解自己也知道哪些部分可以再進步。</p>

<p>有朋友說會當在有利益可圖的時候，會以比較柔軟的手段面對自己覺得不對的事。但這是我想要的嗎？該因為自己的短期利益而對於自己覺得 ”不正確“ 的事默不吭聲嗎？</p>

<p>沈默也是一種選擇，代表著對於接收到的事件的一種默認，就好比投票一樣。我認為目前的我會選擇疏離這種踩到我底線的朋友，畢竟朋友在質不在量。你是五個身旁最靠近的朋友的平均，還是把自己的實力好好提升，這樣就不需要因為外在的因素改變自己，身邊的人是自己認可的也能更踏實。</p>

<p>不過如何柔軟是個我需要學習的課題。</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Other" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[如果身旁有人做出了超過自己底線的事，還會繼續跟他當朋友嗎？]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why I cannot slow down @Green Lake</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/04/02/Why-I-cannot-slow-down-@green-lake.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why I cannot slow down @Green Lake" /><published>2025-04-02T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2025-04-02T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/04/02/Why%20I%20cannot%20slow%20down%20@green%20lake</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/04/02/Why-I-cannot-slow-down-@green-lake.html"><![CDATA[<p>這幾天媽媽來西雅圖找我，這幾天我也發現我好像慢不下來了。</p>
