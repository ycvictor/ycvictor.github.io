## Focaccia

This was my first time making bread and it was way easier than I expected. It turned out so good. You can top it with almost anything and it just can't go wrong. It looks beautiful and, more importantly, it tastes even better!!

## Tips
- Make it when it’s warm! My friend Ellie (big thanks to her for all the help) made this once during winter, but it turned out even better this time. She think it’s because the warmer weather helps reach the target water temperature (~86°F / 30°C) and dough temperature (~75°F / 24°C) more easily.
