- name: Data Analysis for Multi-Hazard Risk Science with NASA JPL
  location: Seattle, WA
  description: "This project aims to define space weather as a hazard and develop a framework to understand its interaction with terrestrial weather in multi-hazard scenarios, particularly its impact on power grids. Solar activity can cause geomagnetic disturbances that induce strong currents (GICs), damaging critical infrastructure. A key example is the 1989 Hydro-Quebec blackout, where a solar storm and winter weather led to a massive power outage, disrupting transportation and communications and costing $2B in damages.​"

  description: The idea started when I was hanging out with friends and we didn’t have our board games with us. We wanted a way to use a laptop or iPad as the game board and our phones as controllers. This project is a Kahoot-style interface for digital board games, allowing you to play your favorite games with friends anytime, anywhere, using devices you already have.
